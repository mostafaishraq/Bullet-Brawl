# Bullet-Brawl

Bullet Brawl is an action-packed multiplayer game designed for 2 players. Each player starts with three lives and a basic weapon, but the real excitement begins as they fight to knock each other off the platforms to reduce their opponent's lives to zero. When players get hit with bullets they are knocked back and the goal is to knock your opponents off the platforms using well-placed shots while being careful not to fall off yourself and remain the last one standing to win. Weapon mystery boxes also spawn at random times around the map and these boxes yield new and exciting weapons. Power-ups also make appearances, adding an extra layer of strategy to the chaos.
